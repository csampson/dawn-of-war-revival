Introduction:
==============================
Heroes Special is a rework of the original Heroes Mod for DOW/WA made by CutterShane. Since CutterShane
sadly died in summer 2006, he wasn't able to continue his impressive work. At this point I want to speak
out my condolences to the relatives of CutterShane. Without his innovative ideas and the solid
implementation, the Heroes Special mod would never have seen the light of the day.

Heroes Special isn't a true successor of the original Heroes mod, since it only focuses on the unit
experience system. Although that's the very heart of all Heroes revisions, the original mod had a lot
more features like fallback, ability auto-cast, etc.

Heroes Special offers you a very clean and structured experience system for Dawn of War: Dark Crusade.
All units gain experience by fighting enemy units and level up if they reach a certain amount of
experience. Heroes special for DC offers a total of 9 experience levels, with all units starting at
level 1. The maximum level which normal units can reach during a battle is 7. Level 8 and 9 are restricted
champion levels which can only be achieved by commanders. Each unit which has gained enough XP for the next
level, needs a certain amount of training time out of battle before they can upgrade.

You will be informed with a message if a unit upgrades and you will also see a visual upgrade effect on the unit.
High level troops get a visible aura which will make it easy to separate them from the unexperienced ones. There
are two aura types, one for elite troops and one for legendary troops.


How to gain experience:
-----------------------

Units gain experience if they are attacked or are attacking other units. They don't gain experience for attacking
a building except the building has weapons and is shooting at them. Builders get experience for constructing
buildings.


Experience Table:
-----------------

Not all units gain new levels with the same speed. Space Marines for example are already experienced and skilled
troops, and therefore it takes longer for them to reach an even higher level. Therefore expect low level troops
like IG squads and basic Ork squads to level up much faster than elite troops like space marine squads or even
terminators. Commanders represent exceptional talented individuals and gain levels as fast as basic troops
although they normally belong already to the experienced and elite units. The following experience table shows
the experience each unit type requires to gain a new level.

            |			Regular		Special		Commando
Level       |	Commanders	Forces		Forces		Forces
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Regular     |	0		0		0		0
Experienced |	1000		1000		1500		2000
Veteran     |	2000		2000		3000		4000
Expert      |	4000		4000		6000		8000
Elite       |	6000		6000		9000		12000
Ultra Elite |	8000		8000		12000		16000
Legendary   |	11000		11000		16500		22000
Champion    |	14000		-		-		-
Hero        |	17000		-		-		-


Training Time:
--------------

Each units which has enough XP to gain a new level must stay a certain time out of battle to be able to upgrade.
It represents the situation of a unit experienceing a bttle situation and after battle it has time to think about
and learn from it. The training time is usually 20 seconds.


Unit upgrades:
--------------

A unit upgrade increases certain stats of a unit, but the unit buffs are not the same for every unit. Each
unit type like builders, commanders, scouts, melee squads, ranged squads, artillery, tanks and walkers follow
a slightly different upgrade path which suit their purpose. Scouts get special sight range increases, builders
get a higher construction rate, melee squads special speed boni, etc.

The typical upgrade buffs of a level upgrade are:

HP:			+10% per level
Morale:			+50 points per level
Weapon Damage:		+10% per level
Weapon Accuracy:	+5% per level
HP Regeneration:	+50% at level 4 and 7 (Not for vehicles)

In addition, all units gain special buffs at level 4 and level 7, while units with levels 4 - 6 count as 'elite' and
units with level 7 and higher count as legendary. Elite and legendary units have unique auras. Those auras are different
for big units like vehicles and small units like the basic troops.

The following list shows the unique upgrade behaviours of the different unit types in Heroes Special:

Builders	=> Construction rate boni
Commanders	=> Higher stat buffs than usual, can reach champion and hero levels
Scout Squads	=> High sight range increase and weapon range increase
Melee Squads	=> 15% health increase per level, special speed buffs at level 4 and 7
Ranged Squads	=> Weapon and sight range increase and a slight speed buff at level 4 and 7
Walkers		=> 15% health increase per level, special speed buffs at level 4 and 7
Tanks		=> Weapon and sight range increase and a slight speed buff at level 4 and 7
Artillery	=> Lesser basic upgrades than normal units, special weapon and sight range increase at level 4 and 7


Generals:
---------
Generals influence the quality of new recruited troops. Generals with a high command level get access to experienced
or even veteran troops. Each race has 1 - 2 generals and the general with the highest level is the commanding general.
The basic command level is 1, which means that there are only basic troops available. An elite general with level 4,
5 or 6 has command level 2 and all new recruited troops start with unit rank experienced. A legendary general with 7,
8 or 9 has command level 3 and all new recruited troops start with unit rank veteran. The following list shows the
generals of each race:

Chaos Marines:	Chaos Lord, Demon Prince
Space Marines:	Force Commander
Eldar:		Farseer
Imperial Guard:	Command Squad
Necrons:	Necron Lord, Destroyer Lord
Orcs:		Mek Boy, Warboss
Tau:		Tau Commander, Ethereal

side of the screen.
