Introduction:
-------------
Heroes Special is intended to be incorporated by other mods, just like the skirmish AI mod. You're to
modify the mod to your wishes as long as you give credits to Cuttershane as the creater of the original
Heroes, me as the developer of the Heroes Special rework and the rest of the skirmish AI team for their
support and quality control.

The basic structure is very similar to the one of the skirmish AI mod. There's a core folder which you
shouldn't touch, except you really know what you do, and a race folder with an info script file for
every race. In addition there's a settings script file in the root folder of the mod which contains
basic settings like the different XP gathering rates and the training time requirement which can also be
set to 0 if you want immediate unit upgrades. Further, all upgrade functions for the different unit types
are located here. If you want to incorporate Heroes Special into a balancing mod, you should have a closer
look on the various stat buffs and change them if you think they might be too heavy or too light.


Race Info Script Files:
-----------------------
They are located in the races folder. Each file contains two big info structs which define the experience
level system for that race. If a race has no info script file, the mod will work, but the units of the race
won't gain any levels.

UnitTypes Info Struct:
----------------------
The first info struct of the file is the UnitTypes struct which should have an entry for every unit of the
race. If a unit has no entry, the unit won't upgrade, but the mod will work without problems. A unit entry
looks like:

chaos_squad_lord =
{
	Title = "Chaos Lord",
	Type = "Commander",
	UpgradeFunction = UpgradeCommander,
	FXType = "Squad",
},

The title is shown at the level upgrade message for the unit.
Type defines which XP table the unit uses. Usually, there are only the types Commander, Regular Forces,
Special Forces and Commando Forces. But you can also define your own types if you want. You only have to add
the type to the UnitRanks info struct, which is explained later.
The upgrade function defines the function name which is called when the unit gains a new level. All upgrade
functions are located in the settings.scar script in the root folder of the mod. You can modify the old ones
or even add new ones if you like.
The FXType can be "Squad" or "Vehicle" and defines which FX setting is used for the unit. Bigger units should
use the "Vehicle" type even if they aren't a vehicle.


UnitRanks Info Struct:
----------------------
The second info struct is the UnitRanks struct which has an entry for every level a unit can gain. The first
entry is defined as level 1, the second as level 2, and so on. A unit rank entry looks like:

{
	Name = "Regular",
	XPRequirements =
	{
		Commander = 0,
		RegularForces = 0,
		SpecialForces = 0,
		CommandoForces = 0,
	},
	UpgradeFX =
	{
		Squad = nil,
		Vehicle = nil,
	},
	AuraFX =
	{
		Squad = nil,
		Vehicle = nil,
	},
	MessageFX =
	{
		Icon = nil,
		Sound = nil,
	},
},

The name is shown in the message which appears if a unit reaches the next level. For example
"Chaos Lord achieved Experienced status". XPRequirements contains the XP requirement for this level. Each unit
type has its own entry here. If you've defined a new unit type like explained before, you have to add an entry
for it here. UpgradeFX, AuraFX and MessageFX contain the info which upgrade effects are used and the aura of
the unit if this level offers one. In the appendix is a list of FX file names which you can use for UpgradeFX and
AuraFX. You can also use a different custom icon/sound for the message. If you are a graphics and FX maniac, you
can really find a challenge here. Making each unit rank of each race unique could keep you busy for a long time.


CommandLevel Info Struct:
-------------------------
The CommandLevel struct defines the required level for a general to get a command level bonus. The basic command
level is always 1 which has neither positive nor negative effects. The first entry defines the required level for
command level 2, the second command level 3, etc. You're also free to let the list empty if you don't want command
level boni.


Ingame unit rank info:
----------------------
You also have to update the heroes.ucs text files in the localized language folders with each rank to see the ingame
unit rank information. Make sure that all level ranks get consecutive string ID's.
