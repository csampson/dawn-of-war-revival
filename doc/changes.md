Changes from vanilla
====================

Space Marines
-------------

### Scout Squad

* Added assault shotgun upgrade, which are combat shotguns that deal moderately high damage, reduce enemy movement speed, and lose little accuracy on the move though are short-ranged and have low armor penetration.
* Removed plasma gun, flamer upgrade options
* Skull Probes are now scout marine 'leaders' rather than stand-alone units. They also saw a slight reduction in req. cost, though their Sabotage ability now requires the Scout Focus: Tactical Support research (see below) and are now Tier 2 units

- Sniper rifles now require Tier 2
- Upgraded armor type from inf_med to inf_high
- Very slight increase in health
- Increased initial melee damage to 14-20
- Increased initial bolter damage to 16-22
- Increased build time from 3s to 4.5s

### Tactical Squad

* Heavy bolters have been removed as an upgrade option
* Added melta guns as an upgrade ("Melta guns are close-range heat-based weapons, capable of reducing nearly any material to molten slag through super-heated blasts.").

- Plasma guns now have generally higher DPS against most targets, with a slower rate of rate

### Devastator Squad

~ Long-range fire support specialists that can equip a variety of heavy weapons
~ Small 5/5 -man squad (plus a sergeant)
~ Initially equipped with heavy bolters
~ Can upgrade to lascannons (anti-armor) and plasma cannons (anti- heavy-infantry and lighter armor, with splash damage)
~ Relatively slow movement speed
~ Not quite as capable in close-combat as Tactical Marines
