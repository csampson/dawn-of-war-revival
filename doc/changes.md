Changes from vanilla
====================

* Nicer models, textures, special fx, and sounds from the awesome Firestorm over Kauruva mod have been integrated
* The more capable and advanced AI from Dawn of Skirmish has been integrated
* Icons from Ultimate Apocalypse have been integrated

- Generally, armor penetration in completed units/armies have been consolidated: all bolt pistols and bolters (for instance) have the same armor penetration values no matter which unit is wiedling them (removing some of the bizarre idiosyncracies from vanilla and simplifying balance). This does not preclude certain units from having higher base damage and accuracy, however
- Pistols (e.g., bolt pistols) are generally more accurate on the move

Space Marines
-------------

### Scouts

* Added assault shotgun upgrade, which are combat shotguns that deal moderately high damage, reduce enemy movement speed, and lose little accuracy on the move (though they are short-ranged and have low armor penetration) -- requires the new Scout Focus: Close Quarters Combat research
* Skull Probes are now scout marine 'leaders' rather than stand-alone units. They also saw a slight reduction in req. cost, though their Sabotage ability now requires the Scout Focus: Tactical Support research (see below) and they now require an Armory to build
* Removed plasma gun, flamer upgrade options -- in vanilla, flamers dealt spectacularly low damage and plasma guns generally paled in comparision to sniper rifles, so their new loadout simply solidifies their role as anti-infantry support units

- Sniper rifles now require Tier 2 and the new Scout Focus: Tactical Support research
- Upgraded armor type from inf_med to inf_high
- Very minute increase in health
- Increased initial melee damage to 14-20
- Increased initial bolter damage to 16-22
- Increased build time from 3s to 4.5s

### Tactical Marines

* Heavy bolters have been removed as an upgrade option. Look to Devastators (listed below) for bringing heavy anti-infantry dakka to bear (though Tacs still retain their role as versatile anti-anything units).
* Added melta guns as an upgrade ("Melta guns are close-range heat-based weapons, capable of reducing nearly any material to molten slag through super-heated blasts."). These serve as high-DPS but shorter ranged alternatives to missile launchers.

- Plasma guns now have generally higher DPS against most targets, with a slower rate of rate. Contrary to vanilla, they're actually more effective against heavy infantry than heavy bolters now and have some basic anti- light vehicle utility. Keep in mind they're not as accurate on the move as in vanilla, though.

### Devastators

~ Long-range fire support specialists that can equip a variety of heavy weapons
~ Small 5-man squad (plus a sergeant)
~ Initially equipped with heavy bolters
~ Can upgrade to lascannons (anti-armor) and plasma cannons (anti- heavy-infantry and lighter armor, with splash damage)
~ Compared to Tactical Marines, they're slower, not as capable in melee combat, all of their weapons have setup times, and their small squad size means they're less durable but they're capable of bringing a serious amount of firepower to bear.

### Assault Marines

* Added flamers as an upgrade option (they're identical to Tactical Marine flamers)
* Added plasma pistols as an upgrade option (less damaging than Tactical Marine plasma guns but more accurate on the move)

- Reduced morale to be in line with Tactical Marines (initially 300, +100 from health research 1, +100 from health research 2, +100 with a sergeant)
- Mild reduction in Melta Bombs damage
- Increased Sergeant's plasma pistol damage to be in line with his Tactical Marine counter-part (so, higher damage)
